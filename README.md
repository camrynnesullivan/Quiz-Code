# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

In this activity I used fundamentals of Javascript to create a quiz on CATS the Musical. First I gathered my data and created variables. Then I created functions and eventListeners for the user input. Finally I displayed that input.

I had trouble linking and creating a score and inital storage function.

## User Story

```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on CATS the Musical that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
